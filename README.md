## RubyCPP

Based on the PRET Repository. This is my own attempt to rewrite ruby's code in C++, my first goal being to get the complete introduction cinematic working since it will throw the base of the code.

## What's now?

So far, I recoded 2/3 of the introduction cinematic. So the real game is coming very soon;)

## What's next

- Finish the introduction cinematic
- Start the real game by coding the engine features.

## Can I contribute?

Of course! If you like C++ and the gameboy advance, this is a nice project. You need to install devKitPro and the mgba emulator to compile and debug.
