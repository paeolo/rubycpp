## RubyCPP ##

Based on the PRET Repository. This is my own attempt to rewrite ruby's code in C++, my first goal being to get the complete introduction working since it will throw the base of the code.

## What's now? ##

So far, the first scene of the introduction is working, without the sound.

## What's next ##

To make the others scene, I think the next step is to think about the sprite script animation engine. There are only four instructions: FRAME, END, LOOP, JUMP. The first sprite to use it is the biker sprite.

Also, the sprite allocator should be improved, ie. include a sorting system depending on priorities, but unlike the original code, this should be called only when a sprite is created or deleted.

So far, you can only delete the last sprites..

Finally, of course, the sound need to be implemented.

## What's next next ##

I planned to finish the introduction soon, but then come the big part, recoding the whole game.

## Can I contribute? ##

Of course! If you like C++ and the gameboy advance, this is a nice project. You need to install devKitPro and the mgba emulator to compile and debug.

## Why C++? ##

I really think there is no overhead using C++ in this project. You can't use exception, everything related to RTTI, iostream, floating-point, etc.. But you can use class, virtual function, std container, new and delete and that's enough to organize things. The main requirement is to code clean.
